<h2 id="bonds">Bonds</h2>
<h3 id="credit-suisse">Credit Suisse</h3>
<p>The key implication of an expected flattening of the U.S. yield curve is that dollar-based investors should prepare to extend duration in 2019. For bonds in other hard currency regions such as Japan, the Eurozone and Switzerland: As yields in most markets remain extremely low, returns are likely to be weak or even negative in 2019.</p>
<h3 id="jpmorgan">JPMorgan</h3>
<p>Rates curve to continue to bearishly flatten and eventually invert in the second half. Look for two- and 10-year yields to reach 3.7% and 3.6%, respectively, in the fourth quarter. FRA/OIS should be biased narrower; overweight Treasuries versus OIS. TIPS breakevens should widen modestly.</p>
<p>Look for net issuance across U.S. fixed income to rise to $2.06 trillion in 2019, but ex-Treasury supply should decline to $941 billion. Institutional investor demand for U.S. debt securities was weak in 2018 and will likely remain weak in 2019.</p>
<h3 id="hsbc">HSBC</h3>
<p>The longer-term risks still look biased to lower rates. We expect the Fed to end its tightening cycle after two more hikes in 2019 and to then ease its policy in 2020. We continue to forecast a 15 basis-point rise in the ECB’s deposit rate in September 2019 as the central bank remains confident inflation is rising towards its target and has brushed aside growth concerns. We are bearish on core rates around the second quarter and forecast the 10-year German yield to rise towards 50 basis points by end-2019.</p>
<h3 id="lombard-odier">Lombard Odier</h3>
<p>We are getting closer to the peak in real rates. We still expect relatively low returns for bonds but begin opportunistically reducing our long-held underweight in sovereign bonds while maintaining a short duration for now.</p>
<h3 id="macquarie">Macquarie</h3>
<p>Long rates in the U.S. and Europe are likely to drift higher over the course of the year, with the U.S. 10-year approaching 3.75 percent by year end, and the German 10-year to 1.25 percent. Japanese long rates will remain under the control of the BOJ.</p>
<h3 id="morgan-stanley">Morgan Stanley</h3>
<p>Narrowing growth and policy differentials should drive convergence in U.S. versus European rates. Curves should flatten across the G-4. We see the U.S. 10-year falling to 2.75 percent by end-2019.</p>
<p>In rates, we prefer U.S. Treasuries and emerging-market local rates over bunds, gilts and JGBs.</p>
<h3 id="natwest">Natwest</h3>
<p>Market volatility still too low; rates volatility should rise. Steeper curves are our highest conviction fixed-income view in 2019. Front-ends should offer good tactical and strategic trades.</p>
<p>Buy some upside inflation, just in case.</p>
<h3 id="northern-trust">Northern Trust</h3>
<p>Other central banks will remain dovish, putting pressure on the Fed to do so as well. The financial markets are telling the Fed to pause its rate-hiking campaign. We expect the Fed will listen and only raise rates once more. Interest rates will remain near current levels.</p>
<h3 id="pimco">Pimco</h3>
<p>Modestly underweight duration, overweight TIPS. Curve, long the belly, short the long end. Underweight European peripheral risk.</p>
<h3 id="russell-investments">Russell Investments</h3>
<p>For government bonds, we like the value offered by Treasuries. Our models give a fair-value yield of 2.7 percent for the U.S. 10-year bond. German, Japanese and U.K. bonds are very expensive, with yields well below fair value. The cycle is headwind for all bond markets as inflation pressures build and central banks tighten further—such as the Fed and Bank of England—or move away from extreme stimulus—such as the ECB and Bank of Japan.</p>
<h3 id="state-street">State Street</h3>
<p>With rates rising and record high duration risk, we favor short-duration corporate exposures and floating rates structures to lower interest rate sensitivity and deliver a more optimal yield and duration profile. This may lead to improved risk-adjusted performance and less drawdown than the broader fixed-income market.</p>
<h3 id="ubs">UBS</h3>
<p>Central bank policy is generally well priced by government bonds, but risks remain. At 45 percent of GDP, debt held by non-financial U.S. firms is at its highest on record. We do not expect credit conditions to deteriorate significantly, but fundamentals are likely to continue to worsen. Within developed markets we like long-duration U.S. government bonds and euroynthetic credit exposure.</p>
<h3 id="vanguard">Vanguard</h3>
<p>U.K. fixed income returns are likely to be in the 1 percent to 2.5 percent range, annualized over the next decade, marginally higher than last year, driven by rising policy rates and higher yields across maturities as policy normalizes. The outlook for global fixed income returns (excluding sterling assets) is centred around 1 percent to 3 percent, annualized, much lower than the historical average of around 7 percent.</p>
<h2 id="multi-asset">Multi Asset</h2>
<h3 id="bank-of-america-merrill-lynch">Bank of America Merrill Lynch</h3>
<p>For 2019, risk-off for stocks and bonds—cash is king.</p>
<p>Global profit growth declines. Earnings growth is expected to decline sharply next year, from more than 15 percent to less than 5 percent on a year-over-year basis. The team is bearish stocks, bonds, and the U.S. dollar; bullish cash and commodities; and long on volatility. We expect to turn tactically risk-on in late spring, but to start 2019 with a bearish asset allocation of 50 percent stocks, 25 percent bonds and 25 percent cash.</p>
<h3 id="barclays">Barclays</h3>
<p>Investment grade and agency mortgage-backed securities over global equities, given our forecast of single-digit equity earnings growth and the view that longer yields will stay close to current levels.</p>
<h3 id="blackrock">BlackRock</h3>
<p>Rising risks call for carefully balancing risk and reward. Exposures to government debt as a portfolio buffer, twinned with high-conviction allocations to assets that offer attractive risk/return prospects.</p>
<p>We prefer stocks over bonds, but our conviction is tempered. In equities, we like quality: cash flow, sustainable growth and clean balance sheets. The U.S. is a favored region, and we see emerging-market equities offering improved compensation for risk.</p>
<h3 id="bnp-paribas">BNP Paribas</h3>
<p>Trade war uncertainty to weigh on equities and emerging markets. With the U.S. trade deficit growing, we expect continued uncertainty regarding China–U.S. trade relations. This will likely add to the drag on global growth and drive up risk premia in global equity markets, particularly the technology sector. Europe and EM are bearing the indirect consequences of this dispute.</p>
<h3 id="brooks-macdonald">Brooks Macdonald</h3>
<p>Given our macroeconomic view, the sector-specific headwinds facing bond markets and relative asset-class valuations, we retain our preference for equities over fixed income.</p>
<h3 id="citigroup">Citigroup</h3>
<p>In a stagnation phase (lower real growth, stable/low-flation) there are lower expected equity market returns, and bonds are the asset class outperformers. Volatility stays high. But after a correction it makes sense to be overweight both.</p>
<h3 id="credit-suisse-1">Credit Suisse</h3>
<p>Our base case for 2019 foresees only a moderate further increase in U.S. yields. This suggests that U.S. fixed income investors should prepare to lengthen duration. In core bond markets outside America where yields are far lower, duration should remain short. In credit, the risk-return trade-off looks better for high-yield than for investment-grade bonds. Equities should continue to outperform on the back of robust earnings growth. Emerging-market assets should regain ground as long as the risk of U.S. rate hikes and dollar strength abates.</p>
<p>Keeping inflation under control is a key driver or risk. The important question is whether inflation will remain benign. If not, the Fed will be seen as behind the curve—bond yields would increase significantly while equities and other risk assets decline substantially. Wage growth will likely be the key driver.</p>
<h3 id="hsbc-1">HSBC</h3>
<p>The multi-asset team’s base case for 2019 “is neither significant retracement nor rebound for global risk assets,” with equity volatility curves “still subdued and expectations for a more dovish Fed mounting.”</p>
<h3 id="jefferies">Jefferies</h3>
<p>Jefferies does not expect a recession in 2019 but the U.S. yield curve is close to inverting just as earnings growth moderates, forcing a trade-off between equity and bond valuations. The Fed’s balance sheet normalization implies an increasing competition for capital favoring quality. Equally, widening credit spreads will mean higher equity volatility. Our 2019 strategy reflects a mature, not end of, cycle.</p>
<p>The bottom line in Europe is that most bourses have their “investment temperature” or monetary conditions set to loosen and while earnings have been revised down this has already been captured in valuations meaning equities look very cheap versus government bonds.</p>
<h3 id="jpmorgan-1">JPMorgan</h3>
<p>The end is not near, but markets will behave like the end of the cycle is at hand. Fed to continue with normalization and Treasury curve to bearishly flatten. Credit is somewhat concerning, but likely to outperform rates. Cash and short-duration should provide strong risk-adjusted returns.</p>
<p>End game should be priced progressively rather than simultaneously across asset classes, unless investors fear a market liquidity crisis.</p>
<p>2019 return projections show improvement on 2018 but are still below average. Given better starting valuations, and a no-recession assumption, the best performers in fixed income could be U.S. high-yield and leveraged loans, U.S. cash and gold. Worst could be bunds, euro high-0grade credit and commodities. Equities could return from 2 percent (japan) to 15 percent (U.S.).</p>
<p>We still think it’s too early for the great rotations from equities into bonds, from cyclical into defensive stocks and from growth into value and quality. Peak EPS growth and the JPM recession risk model are two tools for timing these switches at some point in 2019.</p>
<h3 id="jpmorgan-asset-management">JPMorgan Asset Management</h3>
<p>U.K. investors face the greatest conundrum. A resolution to the current Brexit impasse will be good for the economy, but is likely to challenge Gilts and internationally focused stocks in 2019.</p>
<h3 id="lombard-odier-1">Lombard Odier</h3>
<p>While the U.S. dollar looks as though it has peaked, equity valuations still look promising, despite the inevitable volatility ahead and the risk of a U.S. recession is not on the horizon so far. There are opportunities for the prudent investor to take advantage of an environment that overall remains relatively supportive.</p>
<p>We continue to favor equities over high beta fixed income segments, which are more sensitive to rates as well as potentially suffering from illiquidity. Equity fundamentals are still solid and euro zone, Japanese and emerging markets still look cheap.</p>
<h3 id="morgan-stanley-1">Morgan Stanley</h3>
<p>We double upgrade emerging markets from underweight to overweight and downgrade U.S. stocks to underweight. We like value over growth and see materials as a top sector. We target the S&amp;P 500 at 2,750 by end-2019.</p>
<p>Our trade portfolio is modestly long stocks, and benefits materially from a weaker dollar and lower rates. We like long rest-of-world versus U.S. stocks, global value versus growth and Stoxx miners. We are short USDSEK. We like Treasuries versus gilts and short German Schatz (two year). We are long emerging-market risk via a basket of local bonds (FX-unhedged) and long EM credit versus U.S. high yield.</p>
<p>Strategically, we remain defensively positioned: Equal-weight equities and government bonds, underweight credit and overweight cash.</p>
<h3 id="natwest-1">Natwest</h3>
<p>Any Italy contagion most likely to be felt in credit, currencies.</p>
<p>Brexit: Keep calm and buy sterling, sell pound-denominated fixed income.</p>
<h3 id="northern-trust-1">Northern Trust</h3>
<p>High yield looks attractive compared to equities, especially on a risk adjusted basis. Investment-grade and high-yield fixed income are our only overweights.</p>
<h3 id="oppenheimer-funds">Oppenheimer Funds</h3>
<p>Stocks will outperform bonds, again. International and emerging-market stocks will do well. U.S. growth stocks will outperform U.S. value stocks, again.</p>
<p>Emerging-market local bonds will offer a better risk and return profile than U.S. corporate bonds.</p>
<h3 id="societe-generale">Societe Generale</h3>
<p>Market conditions should, nevertheless, differ somewhat to those of 2018 in several aspects. 2019 is set to be a year of economic re-convergence and no longer a G1-only story. The symmetry of the Fed’s profile should lead market anticipations to swing from fear of more tightening and flattening to fear of less tightening and bull steepening. Meanwhile, the expensive dollar should return to its structural downward trajectory initiated in early 2017 and growth stocks should continue to de-rate. We continue to recommend heavy exposure to 10-year Treasuries.</p>
<p>Going forward, our strategists expect the U.S. dollar rally to fade as the market’s attention turns to the end of the economic cycle in America, as well as the looming fiscal and trade deficit. If markets indeed follow this script, commodity prices could find themselves relatively better supported, even going into the end of the cycle.</p>
<h3 id="state-street-1">State Street</h3>
<p>Target quality over quantity of growth. Get defensive in bonds. Focus on fiscal policy beneficiaries.</p>
<h3 id="ts-lombard">TS Lombard</h3>
<p>The risks are biased to the downside, though trade war resolution would be a big plus. On the other hand, the trade war could easily move from luke-warm to hot, and this would hurt stock prices and aggravate the negative aspects of the world economy</p>
<p>U.S. markets remain volatile because the rising political cacophony, in the U.S. and globally, will leave few openings for investors to separate signal from noise.</p>
<h3 id="ubs-1">UBS</h3>
<p>Our view is that, on balance, overweight equity exposure, combined with relative value trades, and portfolio hedges, is the right positioning for the start of 2019. We expect continued volatility: economic growth is slowing, central banks are tightening policy, and political risks all pose challenges, making hedging prudent.</p>
<p>In a scenario where global economic growth slows but remains solid, while ongoing trade tensions, monetary tightening, and uncertainty about growth keep volatility high: U.S. and European equities gain up to 5 percent, EURUSD 1.15-1.20.</p>
<p>In a scenario where U.S.-China trade disputes induce a slowdown in China, considerable uncertainty, and a rerouting of global trade, more countries will start to feel pain via disrupted supply chains: U.S. equities lose from 5 to 10 percent, Chinese equities drop 20 to 25 percent. EURUSD around 1.10.</p>
<p>In a scenario where negotiations between the U.S. and China result in actual progress and a reduction of trade barriers. Although tensions remain high, both countries agree on a trade truce: U.S stocks climb 10 to 15 percent. Chinese shares add 10 to 15 percent. EURUSD to 1.20-1.25.</p>
<p>In a scenario where Chinese GDP growth returns to a 6.6 to 6.8 percent range, and the current account balance goes back above $100 billion: Chinese equities rally 15 to 20 percent. Emerging-market bonds return 6 to 7 percent. USDCNY to 6.50.</p>
<p>Look for value and quality. We expect U.S. and emerging-market value to outperform growth, reversing their 2018 underperformance. Quality companies, meanwhile, with higher profitability, lower financial leverage, and less earnings variability than average, should withstand volatility better than the overall market.</p>
<p>A maturing cycle can be perilous for bond investors as labor markets tighten, corporate leverage increases, and central banks restrict policy. That said, bonds can provide returns and help stabilize portfolios. We see particular opportunities in long-duration U.S. government bonds and Asian high yield. We also favor euro “synthetic credit exposure,” a strategy that offers exposure to corporate credit by selling credit default swaps instead of buying cash bonds. Various investment vehicles, such as notes, can provide access to this market.</p>
<h3 id="vanguard-1">Vanguard</h3>
<p>Vanguard’s outlook for the returns on global stocks and bonds is subdued due to stretched equity valuations and low interest rates. Downside risks are particularly elevated in the equity market. Although we are hardpressed to find compelling evidence of financial bubbles, risk premia for many asset classes appear slim.</p>
<p>As was the case last year, the risk of a correction for equities and other high-beta assets is projected to be considerably higher than for high-quality fixed income portfolios, whose expected returns over the next five years are positive only in nominal terms.</p>
<h2 id="credit">Credit</h2>
<h3 id="bank-of-america-merrill-lynch-1">Bank of America Merrill Lynch</h3>
<p>Credit cycle continues, despite widening spreads and flattening curves. Globally, the credit markets face high levels of episodic volatility with shrinking supply and quantitative tightening putting upward pressure on investment grade and high yield bond spreads. In the U.S., total returns of 1.42 percent are forecast for high grade corporate bonds and 2.4 percent for high yield. The U.S.-leveraged loan market remains a bright spot, with total returns of between 4 and 5 percent.</p>
<h3 id="barclays-1">Barclays</h3>
<p>The credit cycle will not end in 2019 and the chances remain low even for early 2020. Expect spreads to move wider in the second half of 2019, since higher-quality credit spreads typically increase four to five quarters ahead of a recession. Modest spread widening is expected across most credit markets and therefore total returns to be firmly in the black. In excess return terms, expect Europe to be just above the U.S., but if the rate moves play out, dollar total returns will likely be superior.</p>
<h3 id="bnp-paribas-1">BNP Paribas</h3>
<p>The one well-flagged risk is the U.S. corporate sector’s leverage level and the fact that corporate America will face a large refinancing burden, starting in 2019 and worsening in 2020, 2021 and 2022. This will take place in a world of higher yields and weaker margins. We expect defaults to pick up in 2019 and accelerate in 2020, leading to a more marked economic slowdown in that year.</p>
<h3 id="brooks-macdonald-1">Brooks Macdonald</h3>
<p>Within fixed income we are most cautious on credit markets. There has been a significant increase in corporate leverage over the last few years, particularly among smaller-capitalisation companies, as businesses have sought to take advantage of the low interest rate environment to take on debt. Meanwhile, there has been a simultaneous deterioration in the quality of bond issuance throughout credit markets. Both of these factors add risk to the sector, in which valuations are already high.</p>
<h3 id="citigroup-1">Citigroup</h3>
<p>In credit overall, remain underweight, with no changes to allocations. Cash remains at neutral.</p>
<h3 id="credit-suisse-2">Credit Suisse</h3>
<p>As long as the global economy avoids a contraction in 2019, as we assume, our analysis suggests that credit should outperform Treasuries. U.S. investment grade bonds seem less attractive; although cash positions of U.S. corporations remain quite high, leverage has increased substantially since 2014 due to stock buybacks and higher investment spending. Senior loans still seem attractive in Europe as bank asset quality should continue to improve. However, a specific tail risk for European credit is a loss of fiscal discipline in Italy and rising concerns regarding a possible Italian exit from the euro.</p>
<h3 id="hsbc-2">HSBC</h3>
<p>We downgrade our view to mildly bearish on both investment-grade and high-yield dollar-denominated credit from neutral and forecast reduced corporate bond issuance in 2019.</p>
<h3 id="jefferies-1">Jefferies</h3>
<p>Don’t fear an inversion. Our analysis shows that it is not a perfect timing tool and the Fed’s QE program has distorted the conclusions. Credit spreads have been too tight and any widening must be seen in the context of “normalization.” That said, higher spreads = higher volatility.</p>
<h3 id="jpmorgan-2">JPMorgan</h3>
<p>Investors’ fears about credit are somewhat overblown, but we don’t expect returns to be particularly compelling in 2019 either. Look for spread widening across sectors. MBS spreads have widened 20 basis points in 2018 and valuations appear attractive. Overweight MBS versus Treasuries.</p>
<h3 id="lombard-odier-2">Lombard Odier</h3>
<p>We remain underweight credit and hold no high-yield bonds.</p>
<h3 id="morgan-stanley-2">Morgan Stanley</h3>
<p>Be defensive on securitized credit. We forecast wider spreads across securitized credit and sharp underperformance in BBs. Agency MBS spreads widen, but outperform investment grade credit.</p>
<p>In credit, we prefer emerging-market sovereign credit to developed-market and securitized credit.</p>
<h3 id="oppenheimer-funds-1">Oppenheimer Funds</h3>
<p>The best-case scenario for most U.S. fixed income sectors will be coupon-like returns.</p>
<h3 id="pimco-1">Pimco</h3>
<p>We continue to be concerned about crowded credit positioning in the market and credit market structure/illiquidity, which could lead to significant overshooting in the event of a more generalized bout of credit market weakness. Cautious on generic corporate credit, but see relative value in financials and mortgages.</p>
<h3 id="russell-investments-1">Russell Investments</h3>
<p>High-yield credit is expensive and losing cycle support, as is typical this late in the cycle, when profit growth slows and there are concerns about defaults.</p>
<h3 id="state-street-2">State Street</h3>
<p>Investors interested in boosting yield without taking too much credit risk or duration induced downside risks may be better served by a one- to three-year corporate bond exposure than one- to five-year corporate (compensation for the four- to five-year corporate bucket provides little pickup in yield for the extended duration). An active short-duration strategy may also be ideal to balance yield, duration and credit risks across many different bonds.</p>
<h3 id="ts-lombard-1">TS Lombard</h3>
<p>CLOs have been an important source of non-bank financing for firms. The rise of money market yields and apprehension about the future together should force a repricing of these vehicles to ensure a sufficient supply of investment capital. Firms dependent on this financing will face a meaningfully positive cost of capital for the first time in 10 years.</p>
<h2 id="currencies">Currencies</h2>
<h3 id="bank-of-america-merrill-lynch-2">Bank of America Merrill Lynch</h3>
<p>Cash gets competitive. With cash yields higher than dividend yields for 60 percent of the S&amp;P 500 already, cash becomes even more competitive in 2019. This year boils down to a strategy of buying sources of cash and selling users of cash.</p>
<p>A weaker dollar is expected in 2019, against a stronger euro and Japanese yen. The strength of the dollar will depend heavily on evolution of the trade relationship between China and the U.S., which in the short term may mean selling the dollar against an insulated currency such as the British pound or Swiss franc.</p>
<h3 id="credit-suisse-3">Credit Suisse</h3>
<p>Stable dollar. With Federal Reserve tightening well advanced, and the European Central Bank as well as the Bank of Japan gradually catching up, chances are good that the dollar will be stable. That should ease the strain on economies depending on cheap dollar funding, and help stabilize financial markets.</p>
<h3 id="lombard-odier-3">Lombard Odier</h3>
<p>We expect 2019 to bring broad-based dollar depreciation due to the declining effect of 2018’s expansionary fiscal policy, followed by fading U.S. growth.</p>
<p>We believe the U.K. will avoid a hard or no deal Brexit, because Theresa May eventually gets a withdrawal agreement through Parliament, or because the country halts the process unilaterally. Both scenarios would be pound positive.</p>
<h3 id="macquarie-1">Macquarie</h3>
<p>The dollar should remain supported in the first half, but we expect it to peak and then decline a little in the second half as U.S. growth catches down to the rest of the world and the market begins to focus on the end of Fed tightening and a possible ECB hike.</p>
<h3 id="morgan-stanley-3">Morgan Stanley</h3>
<p>We forecast a major peak in the dollar and outperformance by European currencies (SEK, GBP, EUR). In emerging markets, CEEMEA outperforms, while MXN and low-yielding Asia lag.</p>
<h3 id="natwest-2">Natwest</h3>
<p>Twin deficits will weigh on the U.S. dollar in 2019. Emerging-market currencies have pockets of value.</p>
<h3 id="oppenheimer-funds-2">Oppenheimer Funds</h3>
<p>The U.S. dollar will be stable or weaker.</p>
<h3 id="russell-investments-2">Russell Investments</h3>
<p>U.S. dollar to have modest upside potential; Japanese yen to be the strongest major currency.</p>
<p>The yen is our preferred currency. It’s significantly undervalued, getting cycle support as the BOJ becomes less dovish, and it has contrarian sentiment support from extreme short positions in the market. The euro and British sterling appear undervalued as we move into 2019. The recovery in European economic indicators should support the euro. Sterling will be volatile around the Brexit negotiations but should rebound if a deal is agreed with Europe. It has more upside potential than the euro.</p>
<h3 id="ts-lombard-2">TS Lombard</h3>
<p>More debt needs to be financed with the Fed buying less of it. The needed pull of foreign capital will keep the dollar on the strong side and raise real term yields.</p>
<h3 id="ubs-2">UBS</h3>
<p>Higher U.S. rates in a maturing cycle have pushed rate differentials to record levels, supporting the dollar. While we expect the greenback to retain its strength in the near term, we think the dollar is likely to depreciate over time as policy normalization gets underway in Europe and Japan.</p>
<h2 id="commodities">Commodities</h2>
<h3 id="bank-of-america-merrill-lynch-3">Bank of America Merrill Lynch</h3>
<p>The commodities outlook is modestly positive. We forecast Brent and WTI crude oil prices to average $70 and $59 per barrel. Weather-induced volatility is expected in the near term for U.S. natural gas, yet we remain bearish longer term on strong supply growth. In metals, we remain cautious about copper because of Chinese downside risk. We forecast gold prices will rise to an average of $1,296 per ounce, but could rally to as high as $1,400, driven by U.S. twin deficits and Chinese stimulus.</p>
<h3 id="bnp-paribas-2">BNP Paribas</h3>
<p>Oil to rebound, headline inflation to rise. In spite of the recent correction in oil prices, we expect prices to rise over the next six months, with Brent reaching $82 per barrel in the second quarter.</p>
<h3 id="citigroup-2">Citigroup</h3>
<p>Restore energy to neutral from underweight after the sharp fall in oil prices. Push precious metals to +1.</p>
<h3 id="credit-suisse-4">Credit Suisse</h3>
<p>As long as China’s all-important demand for commodities holds up, cyclical commodities should remain supported.</p>
<h3 id="hsbc-3">HSBC</h3>
<p>We see upside for gold in 2019, but lower forecast average to $1,292 per ounce and expect emerging-market buyers to put a floor on prices.</p>
<h3 id="jpmorgan-3">JPMorgan</h3>
<p>Commodities: Brent in the $55 to $75 per barrel range, gold trending higher to $1,400 per ounce, base metals higher in the first half and lower in the second.</p>
<h3 id="lombard-odier-4">Lombard Odier</h3>
<p>A diversified exposure to commodities is appropriate in this environment. Current prices don’t indicate tight supply-demand balances, with potantial upside in oil and base metals. Escalation of the trade war or Middle East tension would provide upside to gold and/or oil. A solution to the trade war would see base metals outperform.</p>
<h3 id="macquarie-2">Macquarie</h3>
<p>Metals and bulk commodity prices to remain mixed, with base metals outperforming the bulks.</p>
<h3 id="morgan-stanley-4">Morgan Stanley</h3>
<p>A tight oil balance should push Brent to $80 per barrel by end-2019. Forecasts for a weak dollar and lower yields mean we remain bullish on gold.</p>
<h3 id="natwest-3">Natwest</h3>
<p>Oil prices will bounce modestly in 2019.</p>
<h3 id="pimco-2">Pimco</h3>
<p>We are broadly neutral overall on commodity beta risk, combined with a modestly positive view on crude oil. We continue to see gold as a long-duration asset and prefer other long-duration assets, such as U.S. TIPS at current valuations.</p>
<h3 id="societe-generale-1">Societe Generale</h3>
<p>The fundamentals for metals remain constructive and are centered on broadly balanced supply/demand, falling inventories, smelting bottlenecks and moderate demand. Macro sentiment remains negative amid slowing global/China growth and rising protectionism/trade wars. Were it not for the negative macro headwinds prices would be a good deal higher. We are bullish on aluminium prices. Copper prices remain under pressure from negative macro sentiment, but the fundamental supply/demand situation points to a decidedly bullish price outlook. Despite the 30% price decline since the peak in February, we remain neutral on the outlook for zinc prices. Nickel remains our preferred base metal.</p>
<p>While recent price action is likely overdone on many markets, prices for most industrial commodities are unlikely to rise back above this year’s peak. Price volatility should continue to normalize at higher levels for many commodities.</p>
<p>We are moderately bullish on crude oil prices, premised on the fact that the recent sell-off is likely to be partially reversed as Saudi Arabia and OPEC seek to balance the market in 2019. Gold prices could decouple from U.S. monetary policy in 2019 and be buoyed by speculative inflows.</p>
<h3 id="state-street-3">State Street</h3>
<p>Adding gold exposure to a portfolio may help moderate the impact of market volatility and reduce portfolio drawdown. Gold can increase portfolio diversification, mitigate tail risk and enhance long-term returns.</p>

<p>We believe the oil market’s cautious turn is overdone. U.S. sanctions cut a million barrels of Iranian oil from the market at the end of October, a number that will increase. Saudi Arabia has vowed to maintain an equilibrium, but this will push global spare capacity to a 10-year low. And U.S. shale production will be tempered by distribution constraints, with new pipelines only expected to come online in the second half of 2019. On balance, we keep a positive view on crude. Provided OPEC maintains production discipline, we see Brent oil prices at $75 to $80 per barrel.</p>
<p>As 2019 proceeds, a weaker dollar, higher equity market volatility, and signs that the Fed is nearing the end of its hiking cycle should act as tailwinds for gold, which we see climbing to $1,300 per ounce in 12 months. As the cycle advances and volatility picks up, some investors may consider buying more gold for its insurance qualities. We think any dip below $1,200 would offer a particularly attractive entry point.</p>
